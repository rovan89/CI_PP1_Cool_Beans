## Project Goals

### Page Layouts
#### Home Page
The home page is designed to give the user a clear understanding of what this business is, where it is located and when the user can visit the cafe. It is intuitive and easy to navigate. 

#### Menu Page
The design of the menu page was to keep it simple and in a table format. I used an image of black and white bricks as the background and had the menu in a table with an overlay effect. It is clear, straightforward and easy to read. Below the menu there is a section on fairtrade, this consists of a video on fair trade coffee faring and a block of text to back it up.

#### Gallery
The images in the gallery page are selected to showcase the options on the menu, convey the vibe of the cafe and to attract the intended customer demographic.

### Newsletter
The intention of the newsletter is to capture customers details and develop a direct line of contact. This enables the owner to target this specific demographic and generate more revenue. 

## Features

### Navigation Bar

* The navigation bar allows the user the easily navigate their way through the website instinctively.
* The navigation bar consists of four different links to pages and the logo which is a link for the home page. These pages are Home, Menu, Gallery and Contact.git  
* This is a responsive design which changes from standard desktop navigation links that are arranged across the top of the page, to the dropdown menu for smaller screens such as mobile and tablet.

* For the user's information, the address of the Cafe is on the left of the footer.

* On the right of the footer the user can find four social media icons which link to the cafe's social media pages, this is great for exposure to the user.
